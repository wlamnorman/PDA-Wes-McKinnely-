    "### Numpy: Numerical Python. \n",
    "fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray. Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematical operations between arrays. many librarys use ndarray objects, i.e depend on numpy, FORTRAN/C can operate on numpy data without having to reformat/copy data.\n",

    "### Pandas\n",
    "dataframe for data analysis, builds on the idea of numpy. equiped with many useful functions for data manipulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### matplotlib\n",
    "for producing plots and data vizualisation. good default vizualisation tool.\n",

    "### SciPy\n",
    "collection of packages for scientific computing:\n",
    "- scipy.integrate: Numerical integration routines and differential equation solvers\n",

    "- scipy.sparse: Sparse matrices and sparse linear system solvers\n",
    "- scipy.special: Wrapper around SPECFUN, a FORTRAN library implementing many common mathematical functions, such as the gamma function\n",
    "- scipy.stats: Standard continuous and discrete probability distributions (density functions, samplers, continuous distribution functions), various statistical tests, and more descriptive statistics\n",

    "### scikit-learn\n",
    "general-purpose ML toolkit (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/ lots of information about methods/algorithms!)\n",
    "- Classification: SVM, nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, etc.\n",
    "- Regression: Lasso, ridge regression, etc.\n",
    "- Clustering: k-means, spectral clustering, etc.\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, feature selection, matrix factorization, etc.\n",
    "- Model selection: Grid search, cross-validation, metrics\n",
    "- Preprocessing: Feature extraction, normalization\n",

    "- Analysis of variance (ANOVA)\n",
    "- Time series analysis: AR, ARMA, ARIMA, VAR, and other models\n",
    "- Nonparametric methods: Kernel density estimation, kernel regression\n",
    "- Visualization of statistical model results\n",
    "where to focus is on statistical inference, uncertainty estimates and p-values. Scikit-learn is more focused on predictions in comparison.\n",

    "### TensorFlow, PyTorch\n",
    "newer populular projects focused on ML/AI, good next topic after this book."
